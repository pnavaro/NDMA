Goal: write classes and tests to generate parameters in DSGRN-compatible regions, i.e. algebraically defined regions in high-dimensional spaces

random_walk_* showcases some examples of selecting a region and creating datapoints in that region through a restricted 
random walk / brownian motion. Results in low dimensions seem encouraging. Tested cases at the moment: 2D, 3D, Toggle Switch (6D).
Key elements are coded in tools_random_walk
